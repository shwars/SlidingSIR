## Running the Code

The easiest way to run the code is to [clone the repository](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/shwars/SlidingSir?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-dmitryso) in [Azure Notebooks])https://soshnikov.com/azure/8-reasons-why-you-absolutely-need-azure-notebooks/), or use [Visual Studio Codespaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/codespaces/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-dmitryso) to open the code.

## Provided Files

* `notebooks/EpiModelling.ipynb` is the notebook that describes the basics of SIR epidemic modelling, and applies our *Sliding SIR* idea to the epidemic in Moscow
* `notebooks/SlidingSIR.ipynb` contains the code that applies *Sliding SIR* to many countries based on publicly available data, and ties this to *Apple Mobility Index* 
* `data` directory contains the snapshot of datasets used in our modelling. The code uses online publicly available datasets, but should they become unavailable - you would still be able to test the code with the data provided there

## Some Results

The methodology is described [in this blog post][blog]. Here are a few obtained results:
